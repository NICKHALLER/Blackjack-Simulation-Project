# Blackjack-Simulation-Project
Monte Carlo simulation of 10000 blackjack games comparing basic strategy to intermediate strategy


## Key Features

- Basic and intermediate player strategy logic
- Profit tracking over 10000 games
- Win/Loss/Push percentage breakdown
- visualized results


## Strategy
- Basic: Hit/stand based on thresholds
- Intermediate: Implements doubling on 9-11 and always splits Aces and 8s
- Dealer hits until 17+

## Results
Basic strategy yielded severe negative profit. Intermediate strategy yielded a net profit despite lower win% than loss%

## Skills
- Python (Matplotlib, Random)


ChatGPT was used for logic structuring and debugging to accelerate learning and implementation
